;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Sometimes, it would be nice to edit a file in two ways at once. For
;; instance, you might have a source file in a computational language with
;; richly marked documentation. As Emacs is a modal editor, you can edit one
;; in a mode for the computational language or for the marked up
;; documentation.
;;
;; One solution to this is to use one of the multiple-mode tools which are
;; available. The problem with this is that generally need some support from
;; the modes in question. In addition, they also require tools that work with
;; the mixed content; for example, Haskells literate mode.
;;
;; Linked buffers provide an alternative solution. Two linked buffers, by
;; default, the two share content but are otherwise independent. Therefore,
;; you can have two buffers open, each showing the content in different modes;
;; to switch modes, you simply switch buffers. The content, location of point,
;; and view are shared.
;;
;; However, linked-buffers also a bi-directional transformation between the
;; two. If this is done, then the two can have different but related text. It
;; is possible to configure the transformation for any two pairs of modes.
;;
;; Main entry points are `linked-buffer-split-window-right' and
;; `linked-buffer-split-window-below' both of which create a linked buffer in
;; the new window. Programmatically `linked-buffer-create', well, creates a
;; linked-buffer.
;;
;;; Configuration:
;;
;; linked-buffers are configurable in a large number of ways. It is possible
;; to control the nature of the transformation, the default buffer name that a
;; linked-buffer takes, and the file location (or not) of the linked-buffer.
;; For this release of linked-buffer currently, each buffer can only be linked
;; to a single buffer, although this restriction will be removed in later
;; versions.
;;
;; Configuration of a buffer happens in one of two places. First,
;; `linked-buffer-init' is run when a linked-buffer is first created. This
;; function should set the actual configuration `linked-buffer-config', and is
;; mostly designed for use as a file-local variable. All subsequent
;; configuration happens through `linked-buffer-config' which is an EIEIO
;; object and associated methods.
;;
;; Currently, I have only two concrete and one abstract configurations -- one
;; which copies all text exactly, but does not transfer text-properties (which
;; indirect-buffers do). There is a block-comment configuration which is
;; designed for syntaxes where beginning on line comments are required in
;; blocks of one buffer but not in the other. Finally, there is a concrete
;; extension of the block-comment configuration which is allows transformation
;; between Clojure code and latex.
;;
;; More configurations will be forth-coming -- next on the list will be
;; Emacs-Lisp to either asciidoc or markdown, so that this source can be made
;; literate.
;;
;; I think that the current configuration scheme is good enough for the
;; future, but only time will tell and it should still be considered
;; preliminary.
;;
;;; Status:
;;
;; This is an early release partly because I am interested in comments.
;; Hopefully, it will crash rather than hang Emacs. It currently performs
;; badly on large buffers, especially changes which make many small changes.
;; There are some outstanding bugs.

;;; Code:
(defvar linked-buffer-init 'linked-buffer-default-init
  "Function that initializes a linked-buffer. This should set up
`linked-buffer-config' appropriately and do")

;; In future versions, this may get turned into a list so that we can have
;; multiple linked buffers, but it is not clear how the user interface
;; functions such as `linked-buffer-swap-window' would work now.
